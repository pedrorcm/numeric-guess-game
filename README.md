# numeric-guess-game

This script generates a random number between 0 and 100, and gives a certain number of attempts for the user to get it.

It calculates a number of points with a simple formula, accordingly to the number of attempts made to win. If you lose, you gain no points.
If you win, your name will be added to a .txt that the script creates.
